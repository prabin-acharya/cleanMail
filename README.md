# mail-Gmail

mail-Gmail loads user's Gmail inbox and presents it in a web view.

Displays all of user's unread emails, sent emails and allows them to send and reply to emails using Gmail RESTful API.

I had the idea about this project when working on my another project [mail](https://github.com/prabin-acharya/mail) where users can Sign in and send emails among users.

## Inbox

Lists all of the user's unread emails. Viewed emails are muted. "Sent": lists all of users sent emails.

## Mail

When clicked on an email, it displays its details. Users can reply to the mail or Mark it as read.

## Compose

Users can send a new email.

## Reply mail

Users can reply to emails which takes them to compose form with recipients and subjects filled in.
